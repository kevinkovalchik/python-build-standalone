========================
Python Standalone Builds
========================

Why did I fork this repository? I'm automating the installation of some python tools for non-computer-type people. I really like zstd compression, but lots of these people are going to be using old computers and I just can't have them trying to build zstd from source just so their installation script can extract the python build! So I am going to occasionally be putting up releases from python-standalone-builds here, but using gzip compression so even a potato can extract it.

See the docs in ``docs/`` or online at
https://python-build-standalone.readthedocs.io/.
